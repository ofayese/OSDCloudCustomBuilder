## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Visual Studio Code
- Docker (for DevContainer support)
- PowerShell 7+ (recommended)

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OSDCloudCustomBuilder.git
   cd OSDCloudCustomBuilder
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code with DevContainer:**
   - Open the project in Visual Studio Code
   - Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
   - When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
   - The DevContainer will automatically set up the development environment

3. **Verify the setup:**
   ```powershell
   ./build.ps1 Test
   ```

## üß™ Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Run the existing tests to ensure everything works:
   ```powershell
   ./build.ps1 Test
   ```

### Code Quality and Standards

- **PowerShell Style**: Follow the OTBS (One True Brace Style)
- **Auto-formatting**: Enabled on save in VS Code
- **Linting**: Use PSScriptAnalyzer

Run code analysis:

```powershell
./build.ps1 Analyze
```

### Testing Requirements

- All new functions must have corresponding Pester tests
- Tests should be placed in the `tests/` directory
- Test files should follow the naming pattern: `FunctionName.Tests.ps1`
- Aim for high test coverage

Run tests:

```powershell
./build.ps1 Test
```

### Documentation Standards

- All public functions must have complete help documentation
- Use proper PowerShell comment-based help format
- Add function documentation in `docs/functions/`
- Update README.md if adding new features

Generate documentation:

```powershell
./build.ps1 Docs
```
